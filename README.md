## 👋 Who Am I?

I'm a fearless Freelancer who codes with flair by day, practices Aikido and Judo by night, and never turns down a good tech challenge.

### 💻 My Superpowers

- **Web Design Wizardry:** Beautiful, functional web experiences—if it’s online, I can make it shine.
- **AI & Automation:** I build bots smart enough to make my coffee machine jealous.
- **Prompt Engineer:** I talk to AIs so much, they send me holiday cards.

**Languages:** PHP, HTML, CSS, Python, React  
**Frameworks & Tools:** Bootstrap, Tailwind, Jekyll—if it ends in `.js` or `.css`, I’m on it!

- **Automation Station:** Everything’s automated—except my laundry (still in progress).
